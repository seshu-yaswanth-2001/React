so we can write html elements in two ways

1) React.createElement("h1" {props}, "innerHTML");
example: 
const heading1 = React.createElement(
  "h1",
  {
    key: "2019",
  },
  "Heading 1 from React.createElement"
);

2) directly importing createElement - { createElement } from react and directly writing it as html example

import { createElement } from "react";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom/client";

const heading1 = <h1 key="2019">Heading1 from JSX</h1>;
const heading2 = <h2 key="2020">Heading2 from JSX</h2>;

const container = (
  <div>
    {heading1}
    {heading2}
  </div>
);

const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById("root"));
root.render(container);


The first approach is having very difficulty in writing because of code is growing in vertical fashion which is not that great
